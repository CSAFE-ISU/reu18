This is the 2nd summer REU hosted by CSAFE at Iowa State University. 

The website for the first REU summer is [here](https://csafe-isu.github.io/reu17/)

This summer, the six students will be working on either a [human factors](https://forensicstats.org/our-research/human-factors/) or a [handwriting analysis] (https://forensicstats.org/our-research/statistical-foundations/handwriting-question-document-analysis/) project. They will be using statistical methods to investigate variables influencing mock jurors' verdicts, and to automatically classify handwrittend characters. More detail will be posted as it becomes available.
