This is the 2nd summer REU hosted by CSAFE at Iowa State University. 

The website for the first REU summer is [here](https://csafe-isu.github.io/reu17/)

This summer, the six students will be working on either a [human factors](https://forensicstats.org/our-research/human-factors/) or a [handwriting analysis](https://forensicstats.org/our-research/statistical-foundations/handwriting-question-document-analysis/) project. They will be using statistical methods to investigate variables influencing mock jurors' verdicts, and to automatically classify handwrittend characters. More detail will be posted as it becomes available. 

This summer, our six outstanding students represent their home institutions of [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) (ISU), [Albany State University](https://www.asurams.edu/archives/east/natural-sciences/) (ASU), and [Fayettesville State University](https://www.uncfsu.edu/academics/colleges-schools-and-departments/college-of-arts-and-sciences/department-of-biological-sciences/forensic-science-(bs)) (FSU). Both ASU and FSU are HBCUs and CSAFE partner institutions. ISU is the home institution of CSAFE.
