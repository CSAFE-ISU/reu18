# The "Bell Curve"

- The normal distribution AKA the bell curve AKA the Gaussian distribution is the most well-know statistical distribution outside of statistics 
- Key properties: Symmetric and Unimodal

# Wrong and Useful

- Famous quote by George Box: "All models are wrong but some are useful". Normal distribution is no exception. 
- Many variables are *nearly* normal, but none are exactly normal. 
- The normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.

Like Nearly Headless Nick, the normal distribution isn't perfect, but it gets the job done.

# Formula 

If the variable `\(X\)` is distributed normal with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`, we write 

`$$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$`

The probability density function of the variable `\(X\)` is 

`$$f(x | \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left\{ - \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}$$`


---
class: primary
# Mean, Variance

- The mean parameter, `\(\mu\)`, determines the *center* of the distribution. A peak (or mode) occurs at `\(\mu\)`
- The variance parameter, `\(\sigma^2\)`, determines the *spread* of the distribution 
- If we know that `\(X\)` is normal, and we know the values of `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)`, we know everything there is to know about `\(X\)`.
- `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)` are called the **parameters** of the distribution.

# Standard Normal

The **standard normal distribution** denoted `\(Z\)`, is the normal distribution with `\(\mu = 0\)` and `\(\sigma^2 = 1\)`. 

- All normal random variables can be written in terms of `\(Z\)`
- For `\(X\)` with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`: 
`$$X = \mu + Z \times \sigma$$`

- For any observation `\(x\)` of a normally distributed random variable `\(X\)` with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)` can be written as an observation from `\(Z\)`: 
`$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$`

- Known as the `\(z\)`-score of an observation. It is the number of standard deviations the observation is away from the mean. 

---
class: primary
# `\(z\)`-scores 

- Tells you how "different" an observation is from the mean 
- `\(z\)`-scores less than 0 are below the mean, `\(z\)`-scores greater than 0 are above the mean. `\(z\)`-score of 0 means that `\(x = \mu\)`. 
- Observations with higher `\(z\)`-scores (in absolute value) are "more unusual" than observations with lower `\(z\)`-scores (in absolute value)

**The 68-95-99.7% Rule** 

- About 68% of observations have an absolute `\(z\)`-score less than 1
- About 95% of observations have an absolute `\(z\)`-score less than 2
- About 99.7% of observations have an absolute `\(z\)`-score less than 3
- `\(z\)`-scores of 3 or more are considered very unusual

# Probabilities 

Consider the standard normal, `\(Z\)`. What is the probability that a random observation is less than 0? 

&lt;img src="dists-rand-vars_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Using `R`: 


```r
pnorm(0,mean=0, sd=1)
```

```
## [1] 0.5
```

# Probabilities 

Consider the standard normal, `\(Z\)`. What is the probability that a random observation is greater than 2? 

&lt;img src="dists-rand-vars_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Using `R`: 


```r
1- pnorm(2,mean=0, sd=1)
```

```
## [1] 0.02275013
```

Look at `?pnorm` in `R`. 

---
class: primary
# Percentiles 

What value is the `\(90^{th}\)` percentile of the standard normal distribution? 

`?qnorm`


```r
qnorm(.90, mean = 0, sd  =1)
```

```
## [1] 1.281552
```

So, the value of 1.281552 is greater than 90% of all observations of a standard normal. 

---
class: primary
# Percentiles 

What value is the `\(25^{th}\)` percentile of the standard normal distribution? 


```r
qnorm(.25, mean = 0, sd  =1)
```

```
## [1] -0.6744898
```

So, the value of 0.6744898 is greater than 25% of all observations of a standard normal (and less than 75% of all observations)

# Your Turn 3.1.1

The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is mandatory for many graduate school applications, similar to the ACT/SAT for college applications. A student scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning (VR) section and 157 on the Quantitative Reasoning (QR) section. The mean score for VR section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the QR was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.

1. Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
2. What is the student's `\(z\)`-score on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning
section? 
3. Relative to others, which section did the student do better on?
4. Explain why simply comparing raw scores from the two sections could lead to an incorrect
conclusion as to which section a student did better on.

# Binary trials

- A variable is **binary** if there are only 2 disjoint outcomes
- The 2 outcomes are \{success, failure\}.
- A "success" is assigned a 1, and a "failure" is assigned a 0
- Defined as you choose! 
- Example: "Succes" is a juror returning a verdict of "guilty" while a failure is a juror returning a verdict of "not guilty"
- Notation for binary variables: 
`$$X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if juror returns guilty verdict} \\ 0 &amp; \text{if juror returns not guilty verdict} \end{cases}$$`

---
class: primary
# Probability in binary trials

- If `\(X\)` is a random binary process, then we can write it in terms of the probability of success `\(p\)`.
- `\(p = P(X = 1)\)`
- `\(P(X = 0) = 1- p\)`
- Expected value: `\(E[X] = p\)`
- Variance: `\(Var(X) = p(1-p)\)`

---
class: primary
# Many independent binary trials

- Suppose the probability of a juror giving a guilty verdict is 0.1
- Suppose we have 12 jurors on a jury, and we assume they are independent (though this is not actually true)
- What is the probability of a guilty verdict? (All 12 jurors agree the defendant is guilty)

Each juror's verdict can be written as a random binary variable: `\(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{12}\)`. `\(X_i = 1\)` if juror `\(i\)` says "guilty", and is 0 if "not guilty". We want `\(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, \dots, X_{12}=1\)` 

- `\(p = 0.1\)`
- Write: `\(P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, \dots, X_{12}=1) = P(X_1 = 1) \times P(X_2 = 1) \times \cdots \times P(X_{12} = 1) = (0.1)^{12}\)`
- Thus, `\(P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1, \dots, X_{12}=1) = 10^{-12}\)`

---
class: primary
# Binomial Distribution 

Let `\(X\)` be a random variable that has a binomial distribution. 

The **binomial distribution** describes the probability of having exactly `\(x\)` successes in `\(n\)` independent binary trials with probability of a success `\(p\)`. The formula is: 

`$$P(X = x) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$`

- `\(n\)`: the number of independent binary trials
- `\(p\)`: the probability of success
- `\(x\)`: the number of successes
- `\(1-p\)`: the probability of failure
- `\(n-x\)`: the number of failures 
- `\(\binom{n}{x}\)`: the number of ways to choose which of the `\(n\)` trials will be the `\(x\)` successes

---
class: primary
# Sidetrack: combinations 

- Combinitions operation: `\(\binom{n}{k}\)` is read as " `\(n\)` choose `\(k\)`". This is the number of ways to choose `\(k\)` observations from `\(n\)` things. (Note that order doesn't matter. Choosing {1,2} from {1,2,3} is the same as choosing {2,1}.)  
- `\(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\)`
- Factorial: `\(n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1\)` 
- Example: Flip a coin 4 times. How many ways are there to get two tails? 
- `\(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{2 \cdot 1 \times 2\cdot 1} = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 =6\)`

# Poisson distribution

The **Poisson distribution** is used for estimating the number of events in a large population over a unit of time.

Need to have: 

- fixed population 
- independent observations 
- fixed amount of time 
- known rate of the event occurring 

The **rate** of a Poisson distribution (denoted `\(\lambda\)`) is the average number of occurrences in a fixed population per unit of time

---

# Definition of Poisson

- Suppose we are watching for events, and the number of observed events, `\(X\)`, follows a Poisson distribution with rate `\(\lambda\)`. Then, 
`$$P(X = x) = \frac{\lambda^x\cdot \exp(-\lambda)}{x!}$$`

- `\(x = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\)`

- Mean = `\(\lambda\)`, Variance = `\(\lambda\)`

# Example of Poisson 

- Robberies occur in Atlanta, GA at a yearly rate of 429 per 100,000. 
- That is about 1.17 robberies per day per 100,000 people
- There are about 465,000 people living in Atlanta. 
- That is a rate of about `\(1.17 \times 4.65 = 5.44\)` robberies per day. 
- Let `\(X=\)` the number of that will occur tomorrow in Atlanta. `\(X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)\)` where `\(\lambda = 5.44\)`.

.red[Solution:] `\(\frac{60-75}{8.66} = -1.73\)`. .red[Less than 2 standard deviations away from the mean. Not very unusual.]
3. Calculate the probability that this coffee shop serves 70 customers in one hour during this time of day? 
.red[Solution] `\(P(X= 70) = \frac{75^{70}\cdot \exp(-75)}{70!} = 0.04\)`
