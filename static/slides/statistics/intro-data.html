# Why Statistics? 

- Good scientists use rigorous methods and make careful observations

--
  
- Observations aka **data**: the backbone of a statistical investigation

--

- **Statistics**: "the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data" (from the textbook)

--

- **Statistics**: "a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, classification, analysis, interpretation of numerical facts, for drawing inferences on the basis of their quantifiable likelihood (probability) of data." (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics))

--

- **Statistics**: "the study of variation" (my definition)

# Statistics in context

General investigative process: 

1. Identify a question or problem.
2. Collect relevant data on the topic. 
3. Analyze the data.
4. Form a conclusion.

Where do you think "statistics" fit in?

# The three pieces of statistics 

1. How *best* can we collect data? 
2. How *should* it be analyzed? 
3. And what can we *infer* from the analysis?

# Classical application

Medical trials - e.g. testing a new drug

1. Identify a question or problem.
2. Collect relevant data on the topic. 
3. Analyze the data.

# Step 1

Step 1: Identify a question or problem.

*Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?*

Will patients with stents inserted have better outcomes (fewer and/or more minor strokes) than patients without stents inserted? 

Stents - "a metal or plastic tube inserted into the lumen of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent))

class: primary
# Step 2

Step 2: Collect relevant data on the topic. 

451 at-risk patients volunteered to be studied. Split into 2 groups:

- **Treatment** group (224 patients): Received a stent and medical management (medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification)
- **Control** group (227 patients): Received same medical management as treatment group, but did not receive stents.

What is the purpose of the control group?

# Step 2 (cont.)

- Researchers looked at 2 time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment 
- Results of 5 patients: 

Patient | group | after 30 days | after 365 days
:------:|:------|:-------------:|:-------------:
1       | treatment | no event  | no event
2       | treatment | stroke    | stroke 
3       | treatment | no event  | no event 
...     | ...       |   ...     |  ...
450     | control   | no event  | no event
451     | control   | no event  | no event

---
class: primary
# Step 2 (cont.)

All outcomes in all patients in all groups: 

group | timepoint | outcome | count 
:-----|:---------:|:-------:|:----:
treatment | 0-30 days | stroke | 33
treatment | 0-30 days | no event | 191  
treatment | 0-365 days | stroke | 45
treatment | 0-365 days | no event | 179
control | 0-30 days | stroke | 13
control | 0-30 days | no event | 214
control | 0-365 days | stroke | 28
control | 0-365 days | no event | 199

# Step 3

Step 3: Analyze the data. 

**Summary statistic** - one numerical value that summarizes a large amount of data 

What do you think would be a good summary statistic for this data?

# Step 3

Step 3: Analyze the data

**Summary statistic** - one numerical value that summarizes a large amount of data 

What do you think would be a good summary statistic for this data? .red[Proportion of patients having a stroke]

- Proportion of patients who had a stroke in the treatment group: 45/224 = 0.20 = 20%. 
- Proportion of patients who had a stroke in the control group: 28/227 = 0.12 = 12%.
- Overall proportion of patients who had a stroke: 73/451 = 0.16 = 16%

---
class: primary
# Step 4

Step 4: Form a conclusion.

Surprising result: treatment group has higher rate of stroke (8% more)

- Not what doctors expect
- Is this difference meaningful? 

Not yet equipped with statistical tools to answer the 2nd question: is the difference between stent and non-stent groups so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to random variation? 

We'll get there eventually!

# Your Turn 1.1.1

Researchers studying the effect of temperature on glass looked at the refractive index (RI) measured on 89 different types of glass before and after being exposed to extreme temperatures. The RI value on all glass types was recorded, then the glass was exposed to very cold ( `\(0^o\)` F) or very hot ( `\(400^o\)` F) conditions for 20 minutes. After the glass returned to room temperature, the researchers measured the RI again to see if it was the same or if it had changed. Results are summarized below: 

Group | change | no change | Total
:-----|:------:|:---------:|------:
Heat  | 10     | 33        | 43
Cold  |  2     |  44       |   46
------|--------|-----------|--------
Total | 12     | 77        | 89

# YT 1.1.1 (cont.)

Group | change | no change | Total
:-----|:------:|:---------:|------:
Heat  | 10     | 33        | 43
Cold  |  2     |  44       |   46
------|--------|-----------|--------
Total | 12     | 77        | 89

1. What percent of observations had a change in RI after being exposed to extreme heat? What percent of observations had a change in RI after being exposed to extreme cold?
2. At first glance, does exposure to extreme temperatures appear to have an effect on RI of glass? Explain.
3. Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real change in RI for either group? 
4. Do you think the effect may just be due to random variability (as opposed to temperature)?

# Your Turn 1.2.1

Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Levels of `\(CO\)` were recorded in ppm, `\(NO_2\)` and `\(O_3\)` in pphm, and coarse particulate matter ( `\(PM_{10}\)` ) in `\(\mu g/m^3\)`. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient `\(PM_{10}\)` and, to a lesser degree, `\(CO\)` concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. In this study, identify: 

1. The observational units
2. The variables and their types
3. The main research question

# Populations and samples

Consider 3 research questions

1. What is the average lead content in float glass manufactured in the US? 
2. Since 2010, what is the average length of the training process to become a forensic scientist in the US? 
3. Does a new powder lift up higher quality latent prints than the standard powder? 

For each question: What is the **population** of interest? What would a **sample** be?

# Sampling from a population

Sampling should be **random**

- think about a raffle or roll of a die
- every person has one ticket, every number has one side of the die 


Sampling should be **representative**

- all elements of the population should have a chance to be in the sample

---
class: primary
# Where sampling goes wrong

- **bias**: the method of collection favors one type of response over others. Example: 


&lt;img src="img/dewey.jpg" class="center"&gt;

---
class: primary
# Where sampling goes wrong 

- **non-response**: is a survey where only 20% of people respond *actually* representative? 

Example: survey on drug use in teenagers 

- **convenience sample**: only sample people/things that are most accessible. Sample is not represenative.

Example: How much do people spend on groceries every week? Standing outside of Whole Foods will get very different answers than standing outside of Wal-Mart

# Simple random sampling

Simple random sampling (SRS) is the best way to sample in most cases

- every element of the population could be selected 
- every element of the poulation has the same chance of being selected

**explanatory** variable: may have an effect on the response variable, and you want to study the relationship between the response and expanatory variables

What is the explanatory variable in the 3 scenarios from earlier (if applicable)? 

1. What is the average lead content in float glass manufactured in the US? .red[(discussion)]
2. Since 2010, what is the average length of the training process to become a forensic scientist in the US? .red[(discussion)]
3. Does a new powder lift up higher quality latent prints than the standard powder? .red[powder type (new or old)]

# Correlation `\(\neq\)` Causation

An association between the explanatory and response variable does not always mean that the explanatory variable causes the change in the response variable.

# Causation: only from experiments

- To determine a causal relationship between and explanatory and response variable, an *experiment* must be done
- Often unethical or impossible to do an experiment (e.g. smoking and lung cancer), so an **observational study** is a substitute

Researchers are interested in predicting the amount of lead in a pane of glass by measuring the content of another element that is much cheaper to measure, rubidium. A random sample of 193 panes of glass from homes built before 1950 in Ames, Iowa was taken. The scatterplot below displays the relationship between these two elements.

.small[
1. Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, "Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85% said "no". Based on these results, the school o cials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.

2. A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 crime victims (robbery, assault, etc.) asking whether or not they saught mental health counseling after their crime. A follow-up survey asking asking the same question 3 years later is condcuted, however, only 567 of these original participants are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 people are representative of all crime victims.

"Researchers analyzed the data of 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50 to 60 years old. 23 years later, about 1/4 of the group, or 5,367, had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up sharply with increased smoking; 44% for 1-2 packs a day; and twice the risk for more than 2 packs."

Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain.

# Experimental design 

There are 5 principles of experimental design:

- **Control**: researchers control as much as possible. (This is the reason for placebos. Everyone takes a medication without knowing whether it contains active ingredients.)
- **Randomization**: "evens out" differences that are outside of the researchers' control
- **Replication**: get a large sample! 
- **Blocking**: similar to stratified sampling, where each block shares some characteristic, and treatments are randomly assigned within block
- **Blinding**: the people in the experiment don't know which treatment group they are in. A study is **double-blind** if neither the people receiving nor the people giving the treatment know what the treatment is
